# quantumhack

This hackathon was based on a quantum based blockchain white paper.

We had worked on implementing the basic idea and especially the Proof of Entanglement.

To implement this idea we have to send the quantum server a client message. This message has a hash of the candidate block and a random number. That is K the imput measurement, then the output measurement is determined by the server and client; the results are then compared. 

The following test is then used to determine if the results are within accepted boundaries so that entanglement is confirmed. This is then expressed as follows -

The EPR Steering inequality is used then to solve the problem of the EPR paradox which states that results may disagree despite their being entanglement.

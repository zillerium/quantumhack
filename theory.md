This document outlines some of theory underpinning the concept of EPR Steering and to confirm that particles are in fact entangled using some of the experimental methods used and explained in some of the research documents.

"For example, it may be easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's Hilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum system."
